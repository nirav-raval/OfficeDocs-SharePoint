# Migration Assessment Scan: Large Lists

Learn how to mitigate issues with Large Lists during migration.

## Overview

Lists over 20,000 items historically caused issues with the migration tooling, making the ability to predict the time it takes to migrate sites that contain a larger list to be problematic.

## Data Migration

List data is migrated. However, the larger the list the more unpredictable the migration process. Extremely large lists can result in an extended migration.

> [!NOTE]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 

## Preparing for Migration

Investigate the large lists and determine the need for this content to be migrated to the target environment.

## Post Migration

The migration tooling has built-in validation to ensure all list items are migrated. You want to validate large lists migrated as expected.
