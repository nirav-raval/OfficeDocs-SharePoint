# Migration Assessment Scan: Large Excel Files

Learn how to mitigate issues with large Excel files during migration.
  
## Overview

The maximum limit for opening XLSX files in the browser is 10 MB in the target environment. This setting is configurable in the source environment that may result in a change in behavior for your users. If you attempt to open a file larger than 10 MB from a SharePoint site, it prompts you to open the file in the Excel client application.

## Data Migration

XLSX files are migrated.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.

## Preparing for Migration

Notify users of the expected behavior.

## Post Migration

Attempting to open an XLSX file larger than 10 MB prompts you to open the file in the Excel client. You're prompted with a dialog.
