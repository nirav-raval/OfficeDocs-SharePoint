# Step 2: Scan and assess Google Drives

After you connect to Google, add the tasks (Drives) to scan and assess.

1. Select **Add Drives** and choose a method: to look for new users in Google Drives, target a single source path, or bulk upload the source paths using a CSV file. You can choose to automatically start scanning or do it later. However, all tasks must be scanned before you can migrate them.

2. After adding the tasks, highlight any or all of the tasks and then select **Scan** from the menu bar if you haven't already.
3. Once the scan is complete, a table summary displays to give you an at-a-glance source content overview, scan status, etc.
4. Review the scanned tasks. Search for specific text, or select a filter to review the list more easily or download summary and detailed reports to troubleshoot further.
>[!Important]
> The total number of rows (tasks) in the scan list cannot exceed 50,000.

## Download reports
**Scan summary report** and **Scan detailed reports** are available to assist you in troubleshooting. [Download the generated reports](/sharepointmigration/mm-cloud-reports#download-scan-reports) to investigate any possible issues that might block your migration. 

Check the [status code](/sharepointmigration/mm-cloud-reports#status-codes) in **Scan summary report** to address task-level errors. For file-level errors, refer to the [failure code (*ResultCode*)](/sharepointmigration/mm-cloud-reports#failure-codes) in the **Scan detailed report**.


## Managing Drives that own large amounts of data

Upon completing your scan, download the scan reports and review/address any large source data owners.

A migration task (Google Drive) shouldn't exceed 100,000 items or 1 TB of data. To enable faster transfers, Google Drives with large data sets should be divided into smaller migration tasks based on their root folders.

To split a Drive into multiple migration tasks, follow these steps:

1. Delete the Drive.
1. Select **Add Drives** from the command bar.
1. In the side panel that appears, select **Multiple specific Drives**.
4. Download and edit the provided .csv template file to divide the user into multiple tasks. For example:
    - `LargeDrive01@contoso.com/folder01`  
    - `LargeDrive01@contoso.com/folder02`  
    - `LargeDrive01@contoso.com/folder03`  
    - `LargeDrive01@contoso.com/folder04` 
5. Save the updated .csv file and upload it to create the divided migration tasks.
