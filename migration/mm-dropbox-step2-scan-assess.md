# Step 2: Scan and assess Dropbox folders

After you connect to Dropbox, add the tasks (source paths) to scan and assess your Dropbox folders.

1. Select **Add folders** from the menu bar to choose how to add folders:</br> - **All new folders** to autodiscover all new folders in Dropbox</br>- **Single folder** for only one account, or </br>- **Multiple specific folders** to bulk upload folders by entering them into a CSV file to upload.
2. Choose to **Automatically start scanning now** or choose to scan later.
3. Select **Add**.
4. Highlight any or all of the accounts and then select **Scan** from the menu bar if you chose not to auto scan earlier.
5. Once the scan is complete, a table summary displays to give you an at-a-glance overview of source content, scan status, etc.
6. Review the scanned folders. Search for specific text, or select a filter to review the list more easily.

>[!Important]
> The total number of rows (tasks) in the scan list cannot exceed 50,000.


## Download reports

**Scan summary report** and **Scan detailed reports** are available to assist you in troubleshooting. [Download the generated reports](/sharepointmigration/mm-cloud-reports#download-scan-reports) to investigate any possible issues that might block your migration. 

Check the [status code](/sharepointmigration/mm-cloud-reports#status-codes) in **Scan summary report** to address task-level errors. For file-level errors, refer to the [failure code (*ResultCode*)](/sharepointmigration/mm-cloud-reports#failure-codes) in the **Scan detailed report**.


## Managing Folders that contain large amounts of data

Upon completing your scan, download the scan reports and review/address any large source data owners.

A migration task (Dropbox Team Folder or Member Folder) shouldn't exceed 100,000 items or 1 TB of data. To enable faster transfers, Team Folders or Member Folders in Dropbox with large data sets should be divided into smaller migration tasks based on their root folders.

To split a Team Folder or Member Folder into multiple migration tasks, follow these steps:

1. Delete the Folder.
1. Select **Add folders** from the command bar.
1. In the side panel that appears, select **Multiple specific folders**.
4. Download and edit the provided .csv template file to divide the Folder into multiple tasks. For example:
    - `MemberFolder01@contoso.com/folder01`
    - `MemberFolder01@contoso.com/folder02`
    - `MemberFolder01@contoso.com/folder03`
    - `MemberFolder01@contoso.com/folder04`
5. Save the updated .csv file and upload it to create the divided migration tasks.
