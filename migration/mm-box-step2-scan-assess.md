# Step 2: Scan and assess Box users

> [!NOTE]
> "Step 2: Scan and access Box users" can now be skipped to alleviate Box throttling. Uncheck the **Automatically start scanning now** option in the **Add users** panel if you wish to skip the step. Once the Box users (tasks) are added to the scan list, they can be copied to the migration list instantly for migration operations. Migration Manager doesn't discover any possible errors and warnings before migration if the scan process is skipped.

After you connect, scan and assess your Box user accounts.
1. Select **Add users** from the menu bar to choose how to add users:</br> - **All new users** to autodiscover all new users in Box</br>- **Single user** for only one account,  or </br>- **Multiple specific users** to bulk upload users by entering them into a CSV file to upload.
2. Choose to **Automatically start scanning now** or choose to scan later.
3. Select **Add**.
4. Highlight any or all of the accounts and then select **Scan** if you chose not to auto scan earlier.
5. Once the scan is complete, a table summary displays to give you an at-a-glance source content overview, scan status, etc.
6. Review the scanned users. Search for specific text, or select a filter to review the list more easily.

>[!Important]
> The total number of rows (tasks) in the scan list cannot exceed 50,000.


## Download reports

**Scan summary report** and **Scan detailed reports** are available to assist you in troubleshooting. [Download the generated reports](/sharepointmigration/mm-cloud-reports#download-scan-reports) to investigate any possible issues that might block your migration. 

Check the [status code](/sharepointmigration/mm-cloud-reports#status-codes) in **Scan summary report** to address task-level errors. For file-level errors, refer to the [failure code (*ResultCode*)](/sharepointmigration/mm-cloud-reports#failure-codes) in the **Scan detailed report**.


## Managing users who own large amounts of data

Upon completing your scan, download the Scan reports and review/address any large source data owners.

A migration task (Box user) shouldn't exceed 100,000 items or 1 TB of data. To enable faster transfers, users with large data sets should be divided into smaller migration tasks based on their root folders.

To split a user into multiple migration tasks, follow these steps:

1. Delete the user.
1. Select **Add users** from the command bar.
1. In the side panel that appears, select **Multiple specific users**.
4. Download and edit the provided .csv template file to divide the user into multiple tasks. For example:
    - `LargeUser@contoso.com/folder01`
    - `LargeUser@contoso.com/folder02`
    - `LargeUser@contoso.com/folder03`
    - `LargeUser@contoso.com/folder04`
5. Save the updated .csv file and upload it to create the divided migration tasks.
