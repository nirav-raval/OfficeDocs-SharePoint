# Migration Assessment Scan: File Versions

Learn how to fix issues with file versions during migration.

## Overview

Versions historically impact the length of a migration for a given site in a linear fashion. The more versions you have, the longer it takes to migrate a given site.

## Data Migration

By default, versioning is enabled for all lists and libraries on the target platform. In the destination SharePoint site, there's no limit when versioning is enabled.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.

## Preparing for Migration

Examine the report and determine if preserving versions is needed or not for your business.

## Post Migration

Site owners should validate their version information was migrated as expected.

## Scan Result Reports

The following table describes the columns in the **FileVersions-detail.csv** report.

This scan report provides a list of all the files in the environment that have versions.
