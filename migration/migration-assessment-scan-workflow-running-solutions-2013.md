# Migration Assessment Scan: Workflow Running Solutions 2013

Learn how to fix Workflow Running Solutions 2013 issues that occur during migration.

## Overview

The migration is unable to migrate workflows that are in progress. If a workflow on a site or item is In Progress, it appears as if the workflow was never started on the item before migration. If you have business critical workflows in progress before migration, we recommend you finish the workflow before migration.

## Data Migration

Workflow definitions migrate, however in progress workflow information isn't migrated.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.
  
## Preparing for Migration

Communicate with end users that in progress workflows need to be restarted after migration.

## Post Migration

Communicate with end users that in progress workflows need to be restarted after migration.
