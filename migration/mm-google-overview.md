# Migrate Google Workspace to Microsoft 365 with Migration Manager

Collaborate all in one place by migrating your Google Workspace files, metadata, and permissions to OneDrive and SharePoint in Microsoft 365. 

## How does it work?

- **Step 1:** [Connect to Google](mm-google-step1-connect.md). Sign in to your Google account and install Microsoft 365 migration app in Google Workspace Marketplace. 

- **Step 2:** [Scan and assess](mm-google-step2-scan-assess.md). Add Google Drives for scanning. Once the scans are complete, download [Scan reports](/sharepointmigration/mm-cloud-reports) to investigate any possible issues that might block your migration.
- **Step 3:** [Copy to Migrations list](mm-google-step3-copy-to-migrations.md). After a Google Drive is scanned as "Ready to migrate", you can add them to your migration list.

- **Step 4:** [Review destination paths](mm-google-step4-review-destinations.md). We automatically map source paths to any exactly matching destination paths. Ensure content is being copied to the right place by reviewing and modifying as needed for each destination path.

- **Step 5:** [Map identities](mm-google-step5-map-identities.md). Map your domains, groups and users in Google Drive to those in Microsoft 365 to migrate metadata and permissions correctly.

- **Step 6:** [Migrate and Monitor](mm-google-step6-migrate-monitor.md). After reviewing your [migration setup](/sharepointmigration/mm-project-settings), migrate your Google Drives and monitor the progress.

>[!Tip]
>Watch this video to help get started:  [Migrate Google files to Microsoft 365 with Migration Manager](https://youtu.be/GZ4kTX31U-A).

## Get started

To get started, navigate to [Microsoft 365 Admin Center Home - Setup - Migration and imports](https://admin.microsoft.com/#/featureexplorer/collections/Migrations) and select **Google Drive** or **Google Workspace** to create a migration project. Make sure that you have:

- **Access to the destination**: You must be one of the following roles in the Microsoft 365 tenant where you want to migrate your content: 

  - Global admin
  - OneDrive/SharePoint admin
  - User that is granted with the "[Microsoft 365 Migration Administrator](/sharepointmigration/mm-migration-admin-role)" role

  >[!IMPORTANT]
  >Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions. Using lower permissioned accounts helps improve security for your organization.

- **Access to the source**: Have Google account credentials that have **Read** access to any Google user account you plan to migrate.

- **Prerequisites installed:** Make sure you have the necessary prerequisites installed.

Once a migration project is created, you can start connecting to the source as described in the next step.

> [!NOTE]
> - There are [file size limitations](/sharepointmigration/mm-file-size-limitations) and [unsupported files](/sharepointmigration/mm-unsupported-files) in Migration Manager.
