# Migration Assessment Scan: Unsupported Site Templates

Learn how to fix issues with Unsupported Site Templates during migration.

## Overview

Every SharePoint site is based on a site template. In the SharePoint source environment, it was possible to create site collections using various default templates and templates deployed via Full Trust Code (FTC). However, site collections that are supported for migration are the Team Site and Personal Site templates. The Personal Site Template is used for creating Microsoft OneDrive sites.

Supported Site Templates:

|**Template Friendly Name** |**Template** |**ID** |
|:--------------------------|:------------|:------|
|TeamSite                   |STS          |1      |
|Personal Site              |SPSPERS      |21     |

## Data Migration

Any site that isn't using a Team Site or Personal Site template should be mapped to the Team Site template during migration. The content from the source environment is then copied into the new Team Site on the target.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.

## Preparing for Migration

Use the scan report for Unsupported Site Templates to identify site collections that are impacted. The impacted site's content is copied into a Team Site template during migration, but it's possible the Team Site template doesn't include the features/functionality of the source site.

## Post Migration

Validate that your sites work post migration.
