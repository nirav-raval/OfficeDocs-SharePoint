# Migration Assessment Scan: Site Template Language

## Overview

In SharePoint, it's possible to install language packs and create sites using multiple languages. During a migration, other planning is required to validate sites that aren't using a language familiar to the migration team.

## Data Migration

Site content migrates, but validation of the content requires someone that speaks the language the content is in to confirm everything migrated correctly.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 

## Preparing for Migration

Plan to have appropriate resources available to perform user acceptance testing on the migrated content.

## Post Migration

Content experts need to validate the migrated content.

## Scan Result Reports

The following table describes the columns in the SiteTemplateLanguage-detail.csv report. This scan report provides a list of all the add-ins installed in the environment.
