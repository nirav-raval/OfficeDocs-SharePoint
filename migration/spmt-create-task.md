# Step 3: Create a migration task with the SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT)

When creating a migration task, you can choose to migrate your sites, just your SharePoint Server lists or document libraries, or migrate your SharePoint workflows to Power Automate. A bulk method is also available, letting you enter all your task information into a CSV or JSON file and uploading the file into SPMT.

## Migration types

|How |Description |
|:---|:-----------|
|[Site migration](#site-migration) |Migrate a single site or include all your subsites. Optionally you can choose to modernize your site structure during migration. |
|[List and document library migration](#list-and-document-library-migration) |Enter the site and select the document library where your files are located. |
|[Workflow migration](#workflow-migration) |Migrate SharePoint Server workflows to Power Automate. |
|[Bulk migration using a CSV or JSON file](#bulk-migration) |If you have a large number of sources you can enter them into a CSV or JSON file, and upload the file into SPMT. |

## Before you begin

- **Username and password**. When you first open SPMT, you're prompted for your Microsoft 365 username and password. The credentials you provide must be to the migration *destination*.
- **Proxy connections are not supported.** Using Proxy connections yields errors such as "SharePoint login fail" or "Can't load document library".
- If you're already signed in to the destination site while using SPMT, you aren't prompted again for the same site credentials.

## Site migration

>[!Note]
>If you haven't scanned your site, learn more: [Scan and assess a SharePoint Server site](spmt-scan.md).

1. Start SPMT, and then enter your Microsoft 365 username and password.
2. Select **Add new migration**.

3. Under **Select a method**, choose **Single source URL**.

   :::image type="content" source="media/spmt-select-migration-method.png" alt-text="Select a method of migration.":::

4. Select **Site migration** as your migration type.

   :::image type="content" source="media/spmt-select-migration-type.png" alt-text="Select the type of migration.":::

5. Enter the URL of the SharePoint Server site that you want to migrate, and then select **Next**.

> [!NOTE]
> If not already logged in you may be prompted for the username and password to the SharePoint Server site; it can be UserID or user email.

6. For site migration, select **This site and all subsites**.
7. Under select a destination, choose **SharePoint**.
8. Enter the SharePoint site where you want to migrate your content.
9. Select a site structure. Select either **Keep the classic site structure** (make no changes to the site structure) or **Switch to modern site structure** to modernize your site structure during migration.

10. If you chose **Switch to modern site structure**, select the hub association option if you want the promoted level-one subsites associated with a hub.

   ![Select a site structure hub association.](media/spmt-select-hub-association.png)

11. If you choose to associate with a hub, select the associate destination registration option if you want to register your destination as a hub or associate the sites with an existing hub.

12. If you selected to associate the promoted level-one subsites with an existing hub, select the hub name from the dropdown list, and select **Next**.

    ![Enter the name of an existing hub to associate your sites with.](media/spmt-site-structure-associate-existing-hub.png)

13. Review your migration. Select **Next** to review your migration settings.

14. Select **Start** to begin migration your content.

## List and document library migration

1. Start SPMT, and then enter your Microsoft 365 username and password.
2. Select **Add new migration**.
3. Under **Select a method**, choose **List or document library migration**.
4. Enter the URL of the list or library you want to migrate. Select a list or library from the dropdown list. Select **Next**.
5. Select a destination: **Microsoft Teams**, **SharePoint**, or **OneDrive**. Enter the URL, email address, or Team name where you want to migrate. Select **Next**.
6. Enter the list destination. Select **Next**.
7.Select **Next** to review settings. Select **Start** to begin migration.

## Workflow migration

For a complete overview and step by step solution on migrating SharePoint Server workflows, see:

- [**Migrating SharePoint Workflows with SPMT**](/sharepointmigration/spmt-workflow-overview)

## Bulk migration

If you have many sources to migrate, you can use either a JSON or CSV file to do a bulk migration. You can learn more on how to create a JSON or CSV file for data content migration. See [How to format your JSON or CSV file for data content migration](how-to-format-your-csv-file-for-data-content-migration.md).

1. Start SPMT, and then enter your Microsoft 365 username and password.
2. Select **Add a new migration**.
3. Select **JSON or CSV file for bulk migration.**
4. Enter the full path of your .CSV or .JSON file where your content is located, and then select **Add**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you're migrating files from an on-premises SharePoint Server, you're prompted for your username and password for that site unless you provided those credentials in a previous step.
   >
   > If any errors appear in your file, they're detected on a line-by-line basis. The error indicates which line or lines contain the errors. You can't proceed until you correct the errors in your file.

5. If you want to select another set of data files to migrate, select **Add another migration**. If not, select **Next**. Or choose if you want to save this task for later.
6. Review your settings, and then select **Start**.

## Incremental migration

After a migration task completes, you can save it to be rerun at a later date, allowing you to copy only those new or updated files in the source location.

> [!NOTE]
> If you wish to make changes to this setting, do so before your initial migration job is submitted. This setting is global; it applies to all subsequent tasks you submit.

When this setting is on, an incremental check of the SharePoint target environment is performed. Files are evaluated as follows:

|Status |Result |
|-------|-------|
|Modified time of the source file is earlier than the modified time of the target file. |File isn't migrated. |
|Files or lists exist in the SharePoint target location. |Migration skips those existing objects during scan. |
|Time stamp on files or object in the source location is newer in the source. |The newer files are migrated. |
|Source is a file share. |Validation for migration is based on the file/folder path. |
|Source is an on-premises SharePoint Server. |Validation for migration is based on list item GUID. Use the folder path as a fallback. |

>[!Important]
>We strongly recommend that you don't rename or move migrated files before the final migration is completed. Doing so results in files being overwritten.
