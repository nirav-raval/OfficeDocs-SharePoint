# Migration Assessment Scan: Alerts

Learn how to fix issues with alerts during migration.

## Overview

Most migration tools don't migrate alerts. Alerts are created on items, lists, and libraries to notify a user of when content changed. This report provides visibility into the alerts that are currently configured in the source environment. If users want to be notified of content changes after the migration, they need to configure the alerts on the new environment. As a result of alerts not migrating, we provide ample raw data associated with the alerts if you need to recreate the alerts post-migration.

## Data Migration

Basic migration tools don't migrate alerts.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.
  
## Preparing for Migration

Provide communication with users to avoid confusion post migration.
  
## Post Migration

Provide communication with users to avoid confusion post migration.
