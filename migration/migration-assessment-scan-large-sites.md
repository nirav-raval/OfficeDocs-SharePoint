# Migration Assessment Scan: Large Sites

Learn how to mitigate issues with Large sites during migration.

## Overview

This assessment lets site owners validate site size and makes them aware of larger sites that might take a longer period of time to migrate.

## Data Migration

It's more difficult to predict a migration schedule and delivery of the migration for sites over 500 GB.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.

## Preparing for Migration

## Post Migration
