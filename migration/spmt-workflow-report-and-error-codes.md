# Migration workflow report and error codes

When migrating SharePoint Server workflows to Microsoft 365 using the SharePoint Migration Tool (SPMT), reports are automatically generated. Any error codes encountered are listed in the following table.

## Workflow migration reports

The work migration task generates two reports, one for scans and the other for the migration. These reports are saved to the *WF_xxx/Report/TaskReport_xxx/* folder.

- Workflow scans: **WorkflowScanReport.csv**
- Workflow migrations: **WorkflowMigrationReport.csv**

When a scan or migration fails with either a *SCAN FAILURE* or *FLOW CREATE FAILURE*, the error message and code are provided in the report.
