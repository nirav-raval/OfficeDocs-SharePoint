# Migration Manager: Reports and errors for file share migration

When an organization migrates their on-premises file shares to Microsoft 365, Migration Manager generates log files, summary and task-level reports, and a performance report. Use these reports to help manage, audit, and troubleshoot your migration process.

>[!Note]
>These reports are for file share migration only. For cloud migrations, learn more at: [Reports and errors for cloud migrations](mm-cloud-reports.md)

## How to view the reports

These reports can be viewed while the migration is taking place or after the jobs are complete.

**Viewing task level reports:**

1. To see the report on a task, select the task name from the list.
2. Select **Download task report**. The report downloads after the task is complete.

**Viewing summary reports:**

1. Select one or more completed tasks from the list. Select **Summary report**.
2. An aggregate summary report is downloaded to your computer.

## Download detailed task level reports via PowerShell

To download task level reports, run the following PowerShell cmdlet.

1. [Download the PowerShell script](https://spmt.sharepointonline.com/download/ReportAggregator.zip) and extract the files.
2. **Run** *aggregatereports.ps1*.
3. Enter your tenant credentials.
4. From the Task Filter pane, select how you want to filter your reports:

   ![Screen to choose how to filter Migratino Manager reports](media/mm-reports-powershell-filter.png).

5. The aggregated report zip file is found in the same folder as the PowerShell cmdlet.

## Summary Report

The summary report is an aggregate report that lists all successfully completed, failed, and in-progress tasks.

- **Aggregate Summary Report.csv.** This report contains a single row of data that gives the total picture; including total size, number of files migrated, duration.

When assessing your migration jobs, we recommend that you first look at these summary reports.

|Total to be migrated items |The total number of files and list items that were expected to migrate excluding those files and list items filtered out based on settings or potential scan issues. |
|Migrated items |The total number of files migrated. |
|Items not migrated |The number of files that didn't migrate. |
|Total bytes |The total number of bytes scanned in source destination. |
|Total GB |The total number of gigabytes scanned in source destination. |
|Migrated bytes |The total number of bytes of data migrated. |
|Migrated GB |The total size of the files migrated, expressed in gigabytes. |

|Task failure reason |An explanation of task failure. |
|Agent group |The name of agent group the task was assigned to. |

## Task Reports

When you need to do a more in-depth investigation or a thorough verification of your migration task, the task level reports help you drill down into the specific details.

- **ItemSummary.csv:** A report similar to the overall summary report, except that it aggregates the data just for a single task.
- **ItemFailureReport.csv:** A failure report at the item level. This report is a filtered version of the files report, showing only failures.
- **ItemReport.csv:** A list of all the items this task attempted to do.
- **ScanSummary.csv:** A report that gives statistical totals.
- **StructureReport.csv:** A structure report at the task level.
- **StructureFailureReport.csv:** A structure failure report at the task level.
- **StructureFailureSummary.csv:** An aggregate of all the structural task failure reports. This report is only generated if there are failures.
