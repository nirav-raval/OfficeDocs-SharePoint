## Check prerequisites and settings

Make sure you meet the prerequisites for agent installation, and review the required endpoints. Government cloud customers should confirm the configuration is set correctly.

- [Agent installation prerequisites](mm-prerequisites.md).
- [Required endpoints](mm-prerequisites.md#required-endpoints).
- [Government cloud settings](mm-gov-cloud.md).
- [Pre-provision OneDrive accounts](/onedrive/pre-provision-accounts) If you're migrating to OneDrive accounts, make sure the accounts are provisioned before you migrate. You can do this using a script, as shown here: [Pre-provision OneDrive for users in your organization](/onedrive/pre-provision-accounts).

## Agent error messages

|Message |Action |
|--------|-------|
|*Migration agent couldn't be installed. Close setup and try again.* |You may be using an out-of-date version of the agent setup file to install the agent. For more information, see the [Agent installation failure](#agent-installation-failure) section. |
|*Current user doesn't have access to source file share* |Make sure the source file share is a network file share. Verify that the Windows account associated with the agent has **Read** permissions to the file share you want to migrate. |
|*The source file share doesn't exist* |Make sure the source file share is an existing network file share. Confirm that the Windows account associated with the agent has **Read** permissions to the file share you want to migrate. |

## Destination site URL issues

|Message                                |Recommended action |
|---------------------------------------|-------------------|
|Destination site or web doesn't exist  |Confirm the destination site or subsite exists. If it's a OneDrive account, make sure that it's been pre-provisioned. |
|Failed to check site or web existence. |Confirm the destination site or subsite exists. |

## Frequently seen error messages

|Message |Recommended action |
|--------|-------------------|
|*Invalid source folder* |Confirm the path you entered is correct and follows the proper format. </br>Confirm you have **Read** access to the folder. |
|*The site can't be created or updated* |Make sure that you have permissions to create the site and that the URL is valid. </br>If the site exists, confirm you're the site collection administrator. </br>If it still fails, create the site manually and point the migration tool to this newly created site.|
|*Scan file failure: The folder name is invalid* |See [Invalid file names and file types in OneDrive and SharePoint](https://support.office.com/article/64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa). |
|*Scan file failure: Target path is too long* |See [Invalid file names and file types in OneDrive and SharePoint](https://support.office.com/article/64883a5d-228e-48f5-b3d2-eb39e07630fa). </br>The entire path, including the file name, must contain fewer than 400 characters for OneDrive and SharePoint. |
|*Scan File Failure: Not enough disk space to pack the file* |The disk space available for the migration working folder is too small for the size of your source file. Enlarge your size of your working folder and try again. |
|*Packaging failure: Can't open file* |Packaging failed due to a nonexistent source. Check if you can access the source root folder. |
|*A duplicate task has already been created.* |The CSV file used to do bulk migration can't have duplicate entries. Remove the duplicate line or lines and try again. |
|*The parent folder wasn't migrated* |The parent folder wasn't migrated, therefore all items under the folder fail to migrate. Check your parent folder and retry your migration. |

## Agent installation failure

**Issue:** The migration agent fails to install when using an old version of agent setup file to install agent.

![Screen agent installation failure](media/mm-agent-install-failure-old-setup.png)

**Diagnosis / Investigation**:

An outdated *clientsetup.exe* file could cause this problem.

**Mitigation**:

1. Go to the [Migration center](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2185075) in the SharePoint admin center, and sign in with an account that has [admin permissions](/sharepoint/sharepoint-admin-role) for your organization.
2. Select **Download agent setup file**.
3. Run the *clientsetup.exe* file on the computer or virtual machine you want to install the agent on. Follow the instructions to complete the agent installation.

**Issue:** The migration agent doesn't install successfully, or the clientsetup.exe can't be opened.

Example:

![Migration Manager agent installation failure screenshot.](media/mm-agent-installation-failure.png)

**Diagnosis / Investigation**:

If the *clientsetup.exe* can't be opened:

- Sign in to Windows as Administrator, or provide the Administrator username and password upon opening the application. The Administrator account should already be added to the domain.

If errors occurred during installation process:

- The error message should already include the failure reason, and the appropriate actions to take if possible.
- If errors don't suggest actions to resolve, temporary network failure could cause this problem, or other unknown issues.

**Mitigation**:

If the clientsetup.exe can't be opened:

1. Sign in to Windows as Administrator.
2. Reopen the clientsetup.exe application, or provide the Administrator username and password upon opening the application.

If errors occurred during the installation process:

- For errors with specific stated actions, take the corresponding action and then reopen the clientsetup.exe.
- For other nonspecific errors, make sure your Administrator account is added to the domain. Close the application window and then retry installation.

## Agent disconnected

**Issue**: The state of the agent displays "Disconnected" and never changes.

![Agent disconnected](media/mm-agent-disconnect-ts.png)

**Diagnosis / Investigation**:

- Check the network health on the computer on which the agent is installed.
- If the password of the logged-in Tenant Administrator account is changed, or any other similar, critical changes are applied to the Tenant Admin account that would require you to sign in again, all of the agents are disconnected. Reinstallation is required on all of them.
- If the agent failed to autoupgrade, the version is likely too old. Reinstall the agent.
- Token expiration can also cause the agent to disconnect.

**Mitigation**:

- If there's a network issue, fix that. The agent should reconnect soon after.
- If there are critical changes to the Tenant Admin account that require you to sign in again: Reinstall the agent on all the computers.
- If neither of these options applies, start by reinstalling the agent first.

## Task stuck in "Queued" status

**Issue**: The status of a task stays at "Queued" and never gets scheduled on an agent to run.

![Task stuck in Queued status.](media/mm-task-stuck-in-queued-status.png)

**Diagnosis / Investigation**:

- Make sure there are agents installed for this tenant. They should be listed in the Agents list.
- Check the state of each agent. They should be set to "Enabled".
- A status of "In use" indicates the agent is already processing another task. The agent isn't able to be assigned more tasks without finishing the current one.
- If an agent is listed as "Disabled", enable it.
- If they appear to be "Disconnected" for a long time, check Agent Disconnected.

**Mitigation**:

- If there are available, *enabled agents* in the list, but the tasks haven't been scheduled for a long time: Create another task that is the same. Sometimes it fixes the problem.

## A Task Report can't be downloaded

**Issue**: The Task report can't be downloaded from the link on the task details panel.

- The Download task report link is disabled.
- The Download task report link displays active, but nothing happens after clicking on it.

![Task report can't be downloaded screenshot.](media/mm-task-report-cant-download.png)

**Diagnosis / Investigation**:

- The link, "Download task report", is disabled until the task is finished. Reports are only available after the status of the task has a "Complete" or "Failed" status. Tasks that failed due to time-out also have a disabled task report link.
- If no reports can be downloaded for finished, non-timed-out tasks, most likely there are errors that occurred during the migration process which interrupted the uploading of the reports to SharePoint. However, they can be found locally as long as they exist.

**Mitigation**:

On the computer that completed the task, try to retrieve the reports.

- In folder **%AppData%\Microsoft\SPMigration\Logs\Migration\MigrationTool\[tenant_site]**, or **< Your-Customized-Working-Folder >\Migration\MigrationTool[tenant_site]**, sort the subfolders by their modified time. Find the subfolder whose modified time is the closest to the task's start time. If the task reports exist, it's in the "Report" folder within this subfolder.

Or

- If the task failed, navigate to the folder **%AppData%\Microsoft\SPMigration\Logs**, then sort the subfolders by their modified time. Find the subfolder whose modified time is the closest to the task's start time. The error report is in this subfolder.

## Migration errors in task reports

**Issue**: Migration tasks fail due to various reasons and are detailed in the task reports.

![Migration manager error](media/mm-migration-error-ts.png)

**Diagnosis / Investigation**:

- The failure reasons should already be written in detail to the reports along with suggested solutions.
- If you can't download the task reports, refer to [A Task Report Can't Be Downloaded](#a-task-report-cant-be-downloaded).

**Mitigation**:

Find the specific error here for more information: [Error codes](#error-codes).

If you receive an error similar to this one: *SUBMITTING FAILURE Failed to Submit the Job to Server: Unknown failed reason when submitting a job. 0x01610002*, check the settings on any antivirus application installed on the agent machine. Add our two migration applications as exceptions so that the migration traffic isn't interrupted:

- microsoft.sharepoint.migration.clientservice.exe
- microsoft.sharepoint.migration.mthost.exe

## Google error report shows HTML code in report

**Issue**: Error reports generated for a Google migration sometimes have an HTML code embedded in the report.

![Google error report includes HTML code.](media/mm-troubleshoot-google-error-report-html.png)

**Details**:

Google APIs return HTML errors that are included in the generated reports. This issue may happen when there's a Google server load error.

**Mitigation**:

Run less concurrent transactions.

**Status**:

This issue is a known issue. ETA not set.

## Geo admins not supported

Migration Manager currently doesn't support the Geo admin role for specific scenarios. For file share migrations, these users can't access the **Scans** tab. For cloud migrations, these users can't access the **Scans** tab or the **Migrations** tab.

**Workaround**. Assign the Geo user either a SharePoint admin or Global admin role.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions, helping to improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Users** > [Active users](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850628) page.
2. On the **Active users** page, select the user whose admin role you want to change. In the flyout pane, under **Roles**, select **Manage roles**.
3. Select the admin role that you want to assign to the user. If you don't see the role you're looking for, select **Show all** at the bottom of the list.

## Group inherited SharePoint admins unable to access the Scans and Migrations tabs

Migration Manager doesn't fully support SharePoint admin roles created as a result of joining an Azure group. For file share migrations, these users can't access the **Scans** tab. For cloud migrations, these users can't access the **Scans** tab or the **Migrations** tab.

**Workaround**. Assign the user either a SharePoint admin or Global admin role.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft recommends that you use roles with the fewest permissions, helping to improve security for your organization. Global Administrator is a highly privileged role that should be limited to emergency scenarios when you can't use an existing role.

1. In the admin center, go to the **Users** > [Active users](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=850628) page.
2. On the **Active users** page, select the user whose admin role you want to change. In the flyout pane, under **Roles**, select **Manage roles**.
3. Select the admin role that you want to assign to the user. If you don't see the role you're looking for, select **Show all** at the bottom of the list.

## The site collection "XXXX" can't be created or updated

The User Principal Name (UPN) referenced is invalid. In order to create or update a OneDrive site collection, Microsoft Entra ID must contain the referenced UPN. Check your destination URL and validate that the user exists in Microsoft Entra ID.

## Scan task stuck in "queued" status

**Issue**: The status for a file share scan stays at "Queued" and never gets scheduled on an agent to run.

:::image type="content" source="media/mm-scan-task-issue-1.png" alt-text="Scan task issue stuck in queued phase.":::

**Diagnosis / Investigation**  

- Check the Agent group column for scan tasks. Only agents in the **Default** agent group can be scheduled.

:::image type="content" source="media/mm-scan-task-isssue-2.png" alt-text="Scan task issue troubleshooting.":::

**Mitigation**

- If there's no agents in the **Default** agent group, change the existing agent's group to **Default**. Any scan tasks that were stuck should now move out of this state.
