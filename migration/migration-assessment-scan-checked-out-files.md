# Migration Assessment Scan: Checked-out files

Learn about issues with checked-out files during data migration.

## Overview

Migration reads the source SharePoint farm using an account that has Full Read access to the environment. If a user checks out a file, the migration tooling isn't able to read the checked out file. However, the migration tooling sees the last checked in version of the file instead. To avoid losing data, users should check in their files before their site migration.

## Data Migration

Only checked-in content is migrated. To avoid any potential data loss, encourage users to check in their files before migration. A site administrator can check in a file for a user, however only the content that the user save to SharePoint would be migrated. If a user downloaded the file and was working on it outside of SharePoint, those changes wouldn't appear post check-in.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked), in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.

## Preparing for Migration

Users should ensure that their content is checked-in before the migration date provided.

## Post Migration

Site owners performing user acceptance testing (UAT) on their content should validate that their sites migrated correctly.

## Scan Result Reports

The following table describes the columns in the **CheckedOutFiles-detail.csv** report.

This scan report provides a view of the files that are checked out and which user has the files checked out at the time the scan was executed.
