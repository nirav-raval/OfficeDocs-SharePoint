# Step 2: Scan and assess Egnyte folders

After you connect to Egnyte, add the tasks (source paths) to scan and assess your Egnyte accounts.

1. Select **Add folders** from the menu bar to choose how to add folders:</br> - **All new folders** to autodiscover all new folders in Egnyte</br>- **Single folder** for only one source path,  or </br>- **Multiple specific folders** to bulk upload source paths by entering them into a CSV file to upload.
2. Choose to **Automatically start scanning now** or choose to scan later.
3. Select **Add**.
4. Highlight any or all of the tasks (Egnyte folders) and then select **Scan** from the menu bar if you chose not to auto scan earlier.
5. Once the scan is complete, a table summary displays to give you an at-a-glance overview of source content, scan status, etc.
6. Review the scanned list. Search for specific text, or select a filter to review the list more easily.

>[!Important]
> The total number of rows (tasks) in the scan list cannot exceed 50,000.

## Download reports
