# Migration Assessment Scan: Publishing Pages

## Overview

Publishing sites are typically customized intranet sites that rely on page layouts to allow end users to quickly create articles published to end users. Due to the high level of customization involved with publishing sites, they may be difficult to migrate to SharePoint in Microsoft 365. Migrating these sites may require an extensive amount of remediation effort.

## Data Migration

The files can migrate, however the pages may not function correctly on the new platform. The common causes are changes to SharePoint provided master pages, JavaScript, and CSS files.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.

## Preparing for Migration

Catalog the pages using page layouts. Perform test migrations and plan for post migration remediation. You may find it's easier to start a new portal in SharePoint in Microsoft 365 and archive your on-premises portal once the Microsoft 365 site is up and running.

## Post Migration

Apply the fixes to your page layouts and publishing pages post migration.
