# Migration Assessment Scan: Email Enabled Lists

Learn how to mitigate issues with Email Enabled Lists during migration.

## Overview

It's possible to configure lists that can accept incoming email in the source environment. This feature isn't available on the target environment.

## Data Migration

The contents in the libraries listed in the report migrate, but new emails sent to the library no longer automatically show up as the library no longer accepts incoming emails.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint are skipped. To see a list of locked site collections, see the Locked Sites scan output.

## Preparing for Migration

Communicate with end users that email no longer shows up in the target environment.

## Post Migration

Communicate with end users that email no longer shows up in the target environment.
