# Migration Assessment Scan: Large List Views

Learn how to mitigate issues with Large List Views during migration.

## Overview

It's possible to configure list view throttling on the source environment. There are a set number of hours per day where the throttle on views is lifted. The stated product list limits are in place continuously (24x7) on the target platform. These limits can result in some of your list views being throttled.

## Data Migration

The lists and their data are migrated. List views called out in the scan report aren't viewable post-migration without performing the remediation documented in the following section, **Preparing for Migration**. Any list views containing over 12 lookup columns can also be throttled and require remediation. To learn more, see [Designing large lists and maximizing list performance.](/previous-versions/office/sharepoint-server-2010/cc262813(v=office.14)).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.

## Preparing for Migration

Review the provided report and remediate the large list views before migration. For information on how to optimize list views, see [Manage large lists and libraries in Microsoft 365](https://support.office.com/article/365-b4038448-ec0e-49b7-b853-679d3d8fb784).

## Post Migration

Ensure the lists that you remediated are rendering correctly.
  
## Scan Result Reports

**FileName: LargeListViews-detail.csv** This scan report contains list views that were either throttled, or can be throttled once you migrate to the new platform. The report contains list views that meet one of the following criteria:

- Returned greater than 3,000 items.
- Actively throttled on the scanned environment.
- Contained greater than 12 lookup columns.
- Configured as an aggregate view.
