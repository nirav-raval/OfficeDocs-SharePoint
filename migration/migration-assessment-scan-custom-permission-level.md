# Migration Assessment Scan: Custom Permission Level

## Overview

In SharePoint, it's possible to create a custom permission level and then assign that permission level to users and groups. Some migration tools have problems moving this information to SharePoint. As a result, permissions aren't the same for impacted users and groups post migration.
  
For more information on permission levels, see [Understanding permission levels in SharePoint](/sharepoint/understanding-permission-levels).
  
## Data Migration

With some tooling, this data isn't migrated. We recommend you use the permission levels provided by SharePoint. However, if custom permission levels are required, the permission levels would need to be manually recreated on the SharePoint sites.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site that is configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Determine the plan to move forward by understanding the custom permission levels in use in your source environment. Either move users and groups to the default SharePoint permission levels, or build out a plan for creating the custom permission levels and fixing permissions post migration.
  
## Post Migration

Validate the users and groups have the correct permission levels. If you needed to create custom permission levels, ensure those custom levels are functioning as expected.
  
## Scan Result Reports

The following table describes the columns in the **CustomPermissionLevel-detail.cs** v report. This scan report provides a list of all the custom permission levels in the environment.
