# Migration Assessment Scan: Master Pages

Learn how to mitigate issues with Master pages during migration.
  
## Overview

During migration, the default master page should be set on all migrated sites. This setting ensures the site renders once the migration is complete, as the content migration doesn't have a dependency on any custom master pages. If you have custom master pages assigned to sites, you need to set the Master Page property on the new site after the migration completes.

## Data Migration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Custom master page files (\*.master) shouldn't be migrated to the new platform. The setting on the destination site is set to the default master page. This process ensures the site renders after the migration.

## Preparing for Migration

Review the report and determine where you can move away from custom master pages before you migrate. Plan and understand what post migration work is necessary to use the customized file moving forward.

## Post Migration

If you decide to continue using the customized master page on the new platform, you need to apply the master page setting and validate your customizations work on the new platform.
