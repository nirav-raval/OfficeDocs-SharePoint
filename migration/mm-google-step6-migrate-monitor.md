# Step 6:  Migrate and monitor your Google migration

Once you've reviewed the tasks (Google Drives), confirmed the destinations, and correctly mapped identities, you're ready to migrate.

>[!Important]
>We strongly recommend that you do not rename or move migrated files before the final migration has been completed. Doing so results in files being overwritten.

1. Select the tasks (Google Drives) to migrate.
2. Select **Migrate**.
3. A confirmation panel displays. Select **Migrate**.
4. Once the migration begins, monitor the migration status, and the table summary at the top. Depending on how large your migration, this step may take hours or days.

>[!Note]
> Starting your migration **does not** remove or delete anything from Google Workspace. Content from your Google drive is copied to your specified location in Microsoft 365. Make sure the destinations are correct, as once the migration starts, they cannot be modified.

## Download reports

**Migration summary report** and **Migration detailed reports** are available to assist you in troubleshooting. [Download the generated reports](/sharepointmigration/mm-cloud-reports#download-migration-reports) to investigate any possible issues that occurred during the migration. 

Check the [status code](/sharepointmigration/mm-cloud-reports#status-codes) in **Migration summary report** to address task-level errors. For file-level errors, refer to the [failure code (*ResultCode*)](/sharepointmigration/mm-cloud-reports#failure-codes) in the **Migration detailed report**.

After resolving the issues related to warnings or failed tasks, migrate the tasks again to ensure the successful migration of all required files.

## Delta sync
When a migration task is conducted for the first time, we call it an initial migration or new migration. After the initial migration, the destination can't be changed. If the task is migrated again, we call it a delta sync. We may also call it an incremental sync, or incremental migration. Learn more about [file transfer behaviors in a delta sync](mm-delta-sync.md).


## Migration lanes

At a maximum, only 50 task rows (drives) can run simultaneously. This total includes both scanning and migrating.

If you select more than that total combined number and start scanning or migrating, only 50 randomly chosen rows run. The rest of the tasks are queued.

As a task row completes, another task from the queue starts migrating or scanning automatically. While 50 task rows are the maximum allowed, if a migration experiences any slowdowns or back-off requests, it may drop lower than this number to keep the migration stable.

## Schedule a migration
Migration Manager allows you to schedule a migration for one or multiple tasks. This migration is a one-time migration event. When the scheduled time arrives, Migration Manager starts queuing the scheduled tasks. The queued tasks begin migrating immediately if the migration lane limit isn't reached.

## Estimated time to migrate

After tasks are scanned and copied to migrations, an "estimated time to migrate" is calculated.

The estimated time is based from the time a task starts running to when the completion estimate. When a task starts running, the status is **In progress**. The time a task is "queued" isn't added to the estimated time.

>[!Important]
>If a user modifies the source folder, it must re-scanned and then re-copied to migrations. The estimated time is recalculated based on this new scan.

For incremental tasks, the estimated time to migrate is harder to predict. It can either be faster or slower than first run, depending on how many files are modified in the source. The actual time of incremental runs may vary considerably from the estimate shown.

Ongoing development continues to improve the accuracy of these values.
