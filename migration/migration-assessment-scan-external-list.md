# Migration Assessment Scan: External List

## Overview

External lists are lists created from a Business Catalogs Services (BCS) application. These lists appear to be SharePoint lists, but are actually backed by an external datasource. For example, you could have a list showing data from an external SQL Server or Web Service.

## Data Migration

BCS applications aren't migrated to the target environment. As a result, external lists aren't migrated.

See [Migration Assessment Scan: BCS](migration-assessment-scan-bcs.md) for more information about BCS.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.

## Preparing for Migration

Build out a plan for the external lists. It's possible to configure Hybrid BCS to access on-premises data from SharePoint in Microsoft 365, but this configuration requires some planning.

See [Migration Assessment Scan: BCS](migration-assessment-scan-bcs.md) for more information about BCS.

## Post Migration

Make sure your solutions, which rely on BCS applications, function with the newly deployed BCS applications.
