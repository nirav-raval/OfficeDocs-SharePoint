# Migration Assessment Scan: Customized Pages

Learn how to mitigate issues with Customized Pages during migration.

## Overview

Customized files are out of the box SharePoint files not modified by a user. A common example is using a tool like SharePoint Designer to open a site and modify the default.aspx file of a site. During migration, these pages are reverted to their uncustomized state.

Any file modified by the SharePoint System Account is excluded from the scan report.

For more information on customized files and how to reset a file back to the default, read the following article:

- [Customize a SharePoint page by using remote provisioning and CSS](/sharepoint/dev/solution-guidance/customize-a-sharepoint-page-by-using-remote-provisioning-and-css).
 
## Data Migration

Customized files are reverted to their uncustomized state during migration.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.

## Preparing for Migration

Notify the site collection owners of sites that contain customized pages that they need to reapply any customizations made to impacted files post migration. Page owners should look for out of the box behavior to replace customization where possible.

## Post Migration

Site owners need to reapply any customizations post migration.

## Scan Result Reports
