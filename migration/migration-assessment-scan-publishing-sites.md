# Migration Assessment Scan: Publishing Sites

## Overview

Publishing sites are typically customized intranet sites that rely on page layouts to allow end users to create articles published to end users. Due to the high level of customizations involved with publishing sites, they may be difficult to migrate to SharePoint in Microsoft 365 without many remediations.

## Data Migration

The content in the publishing site may migrate, but any customization typically requires an extensive amount of remediation effort.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.

## Preparing for Migration

Test migration of the sites with the publishing features enabled. Understand what needs to be corrected after migration.

## Post Migration

Apply the fixes to your customized content after migration.
