# Migration Assessment Scan: Managed Metadata Columns

## Overview

In SharePoint, it's possible to add a Managed Metadata column to a list and populate the list field with values from the Managed Metadata Service Application. Migration of these columns requires coordination with migration of the Managed Metadata Service Application data.

## Data Migration

Managed metadata columns are typically migrated, but support depends on the migration tooling you select.
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output. 
  
## Preparing for Migration

Before you start a migration project, you want to understand how many lists use Managed Metadata. You also want to try to migrate these lists close to the time you migrate your Managed Metadata Service Application data to the cloud.

## Post Migration

If migrating managed metadata columns is supported in the migration tooling you chose, make sure the lists using the columns are migrated and properly configured to create and edit list items.

## Scan Result Reports

The following table describes the columns in the **ManagedMetadataLists-detail.csv** report. This scan report includes all lists that contain Managed Metadata columns.
