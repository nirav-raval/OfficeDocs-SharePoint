# Migration Assessment Scan: Sandbox Solution

Learn how to mitigate issues with sandbox solutions during migration.

## Overview

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SharePoint in Microsoft 365 doesn't support sandbox solutions.

SharePoint doesn't support sandbox solutions. As a result, any functionality using the sandbox in your current environment needs to be replaced with a supported technology. See the Office Dev Center Patterns and Practices site for information on building customizations:

[https://pnp.github.io/](https://pnp.github.io/)

## Data Migration

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.
