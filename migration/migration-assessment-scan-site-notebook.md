# Migration Assessment Scan: Site Notebook

## Overview

SharePoint Server 2013 and later support a feature called Site Notebook. This SharePoint feature is activated on the site and generates a OneNote in the Site Assets library of the web. The file is named with the title of the site.

Depending on the migration tools being used, your Site Notebook migrates. However, the name of the Site Notebook in SharePoint in Microsoft 365 is different from the name of the file in the on-premises environment. As a result, links referencing the original file name is broken. This report provides a list of OneNote files that match the following scenario:

- OneNote Notebook files
- Files exist in the Site Assets library
- Files have a name that ends in Notebook
- OneNote isn't empty
- File isn't flagged as deleted

## Data Migration

Depending on the migration tools being used, the Site Notebook migrates but the file has a different name resulting in broken links.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Any site configured as "No Access" (locked) in SharePoint is skipped. To see a list of locked site collections see the Locked Sites scan output.

## Preparing for Migration

Prepare for questions about missing Site Notebooks and provide guidance to impacted users.

## Post Migration

Educate users on the change related to Site Notebooks.
