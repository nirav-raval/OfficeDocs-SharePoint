# Use agents with pay-as-you-go billing

## Set up SharePoint agents as an Azure resource

To use pay-as-you-go billing, you need to first set up SharePoint agents as a resource in Azure. That resource is used whenever a user without a Microsoft 365 Copilot license uses a SharePoint agent.

### Prerequisites to set up SharePoint agents as a resource in Azure

- Have at least a SharePoint administrator role
- Have Owner or Contributor Azure roles to a pay-as-you-go Azure subscription
- Have Owner or Contributor Azure roles to an Azure resource group linked to the same Azure subscription

> [!NOTE]
> - The Owner or Contributor Azure roles are only needed in the time windows where you set up billing.
> -	To grant an owner or Contributor Azure role, follow the instructions [here](/azure/role-based-access-control/role-assignments-portal). 


To set up SharePoint agents as an Azure resource, you need to do the following if you haven't already:

1. [Create an Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/offers/ms-azr-0003p/) with the pay-as-you-go offer. 
1. [Create an Azure resource group](/azure/azure-resource-manager/management/manage-resource-groups-portal#create-resource-groups) for SharePoint agents.

## Set up pay-as-you-go billing for SharePoint agents

After setting up an Azure resource group for SharePoint agents, you can set up pay-as-you-go billing for SharePoint agents in the Microsoft 365 admin center. Here's how:

1. Go to the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Settings** then **Org settings** then select **pay-as-you-go** services (formerly Microsoft Syntex).
    Alternatively, you can select **Setup**, and then in the **Billing and licenses** section, select **Activate pay-as-you-go services**. On the **Activate pay-as-you-go services** page, select **Get started**.
1. On the **Pay-as-you-go services** page, under **Billing**, select **agents in SharePoint**.
1. On the **Set up billing and turn on services** panel, in the **Set up billing** section, under **Azure subscription**, select the dropdown, and then follow the steps to select the Azure subscription, resource group, and region. (The region determines where your tenant ID and usage information such as site names are stored.)
1. Read and accept the pay-as-you-go billing terms of service.
1. Select **Save**.


### Billing rates

The following table illustrates the differences in the subscription models for the cost of SharePoint agent usage.

| SharePoint agent feature              | Billing rate | Use in Microsoft 365 Copilot scenarios<sup>1</sup> | Autonomous use |
|---------------------------------------|--------------|----------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| Generative answer                     | 2 messages   | No charge                                          | 2 messages     |
| Tenant graph grounding for messages   | 10 messages  | No charge                                          | 10 messages    |

<sup>1</sup> Interactive use of generative answers, tenant graph grounding and agent actions by authenticated Microsoft 365 Copilot users, in Microsoft 365 apps and services, are included at no extra cost.

- Generative answers: These events are dynamically generated using AI models, such as Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPTs). They can adapt and change based on the context and the knowledge sources they're connected to. They're useful for handling a wide range of topics and providing more flexible and natural interactions.

- Tenant graph grounding for messages: These events provide higher quality grounding for your agents using retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) over your tenant-wide Microsoft Graph, including external data synced into Microsoft Graph through connectors. This results in more relevant and improved responses and ensures that the grounding information is up-to-date. This capability is optional, and you can turn it on or off for each agent.
  
> [!NOTE]
> - SharePoint agents are grounded in the tenant graph, so each interaction with a SharePoint agent uses 12 messages (10 messages for tenant graph grounding, and 2 messages for generative answers) to respond to a single complex prompt from the user.
> - Charges of SharePoint agent usage appear under the Copilot Studio meter in your invoice. However, in Microsoft cost management, you can see a detailed breakdown by feature, including SharePoint agents.
> - If your organization have [trial access to SharePoint agents](/sharepoint/manage-trial-agents-sharepoint-powershell#what-is-the-trial-access-to-sharepoint-agents), and haven't exceeded the 10,000 free message limit for the month, you won't see any charges related to SharePoint agents.

### Monitor consumption in Microsoft Cost Management

You can monitor your organization's consumption of SharePoint agents with the pay-as-you-go with [Microsoft Cost Management](https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_Azure_CostManagement/Menu/~/overview/openedBy/AzurePortal). If needed, change the scope to select the subscription that is being used for agents in SharePoint.

Select **Reporting + analytics**, then select **Cost analysis** to review and analyze your consumption. Choose to use [**Smart views**](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/quick-acm-cost-analysis#analyze-costs-with-smart-views) to quickly view your consumption by Services, Resources, and Resources groups. You can also create [custom views](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/quick-acm-cost-analysis#analyze-costs-with-customizable-views) to analyze your consumption by different dimensions. 

You can quickly create a budget under **Monitoring** > **Budgets** for your selected scope.

![Screenshot of creating a budget in Microsoft Cost Management.](media/agents-sharepoint/create-budget.png)

Select Alert conditions to set up the budget alert conditions. You can set up alerts for when your actual spending or the forecast reaches a certain percentage of your budget. Select **Manage action group** to set up the action group for the alert. You can choose to send an email, SMS, or push notification to the action group when the alert is triggered.

You can also create a budget in Microsoft Cost Management with [Bicep](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/quick-create-budget-bicep) and [ARM template](/azure/cost-management-billing/costs/quick-create-budget-template).

Budget helps you inform others about their spending to proactively manage costs and monitor how spending progresses over time. When You can also set up various types of cost alerts to monitor the consumption.

You can view your invoices under **Billing** > **Invoices**. Use text search to filter for the invoices you want. You can also filter by **Status** and **Timespan**. You can also download the invoice in CSV format.

#### Adjusting consumption

Using pay-as-you-go billing means that each user is responsible for their own consumption. Work with people in your organization to ensure the efficient use of agents in SharePoint. For example, restrict access to SharePoint sites with agents to only those who need to use them.

### Paying your invoice

Your organization receives an invoice for all Azure services used at the end of each month. You can pay these invoices under the Invoices section in the subscription that you use for agents in SharePoint.

## Disconnect agents from pay-as-you-go billing

To disconnect Agents from pay-as-you-go billing, follow these steps:

1. In the Microsoft 365 admin center, select **Settings** > **Org Settings**.
1. On the **Pay-as-you-go services** page, on the **Billing** tab, select **Agents in SharePoint**.
1. On the **Manage billing** panel, under the Azure Subscription, select **Edit billing information**.
1. Select **Disconnect Azure subscription** under **Manage Billing**.
1. Select **Disconnect** within the **Disconnect Subscription** pop-up window.
1. View confirmation that your Azure Subscription has been disconnected Under **set up billing and turn on services**.
